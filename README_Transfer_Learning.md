# Explanation
#### Custom Dataset: 
The CustomDataset class handles loading images and provides both classification labels and regression targets for each image.

#### Multi-Task Model: 
The MultiTaskModel class combines a pretrained ResNet feature extractor with two heads: one for classification (using CrossEntropyLoss) and one for regression (using MSELoss). This allows the model to predict both a class and a continuous value from the same input image.

#### Training Loop: 
The model is trained using a combination of the classification and regression losses. The losses can be weighted if one task is more important than the other.

#### Optimization: 
The model is fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer, and the entire model, including the pretrained layers, is updated during training.

# Considerations
#### Custom Loss Weighting: 
You can assign different weights to the classification and regression losses depending on their importance. For example, loss = 0.7 * loss_class + 0.3 * loss_reg.

#### Transfer Learning: 
You can freeze the feature extractor layers initially to train only the task-specific heads and then fine-tune the entire model.
Batch Size and Epochs: Adjust these based on your dataset and available computational resources.```
This more complex example demonstrates how to leverage a pretrained model as part of a custom architecture for a multi-task learning scenario, allowing you to tackle problems that require predictions of both discrete classes and continuous values.

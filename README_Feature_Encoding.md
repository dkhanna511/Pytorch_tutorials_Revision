# Explanation
#### Pretrained Model: 
The resnet18 model is pretrained on ImageNet and contains multiple layers. We remove the final fully connected layer to retain only the convolutional and pooling layers, which will be used to extract features.

#### FeatureExtractor Class: 
This custom class wraps the original ResNet model, keeping all layers except the final fully connected layer. The forward method processes the input through the retained layers and outputs a feature vector.

#### Image Preprocessing: 
The input image is resized, center-cropped, converted to a tensor, and normalized according to the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset.

#### Feature Extraction: 
The preprocessed image is passed through the FeatureExtractor model to obtain a feature vector, which can be used as input for downstream tasks like classification, clustering, or as input to another model.

# Customization:
#### Model Selection: 
You can use other pretrained models like VGG, DenseNet, or MobileNet, depending on your requirements.
#### Layer Selection: 
You can modify the FeatureExtractor class to extract features from different layers depending on the level of abstraction required.
#### Input Data: 
This example uses an image, but the approach can be adapted to different types of input data by selecting appropriate models.
This method allows you to leverage powerful pretrained models to extract rich features from your data without having to train a model from scratch.
